            A Chapter 13 reorganization bankruptcy is designed for individuals with adequate income and part of this income will be used to pay debts (or a certain percentage) over a period of time, either in 3 or 5 years. This option allows you to reorganize your debts to give you time to pay.

            Chapter 13 bankruptcy is an effective tool to prevent foreclosure of your home or repossession of your car. Debtors usually avail of this option if they do not want to lose their house or other properties and they have mortgages or other loans they would like to bring current. An “automatic stay” is issued once your petition is filed, i.e., most creditors (with a few exemptions) cannot take any action against your property to collect the outstanding debt.

            To keep your residence under Chapter 7, you should (1) be current in your mortgage payments (or can get current in your payments), (2) can continue paying it, and (3) your home equity is covered by the applicable homestead exemption. Otherwise, Chapter 13 is a better option.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under Chapter 13, you may also be able to convert your second mortgage into an unsecured debt if the value of your residence is equal or less than your first mortgage and that second mortgage is secured solely on your residence (“lien stripping”). By converting it into unsecured debt, you may not have to pay all or part of your second mortgage and thus lower your monthly mortgage payments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Debtors with debts that can’t be discharged under Chapter 7, like taxes, child support, or student loans, can instead file Chapter 13. These debts can be paid over time under the Chapter 13 plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            People with co-debtors often opt to file Chapter 13 instead of Chapter 7 to protect their co-debtors from liability. For instance, if you file Chapter 7 and get a discharge, most, if not all, of your debts will be eliminated. However, if you have a co-debtor, the creditor will likely collect that debt from your co-debtor (like a co-signer in a car or housing loan) if you file Chapter 7.
