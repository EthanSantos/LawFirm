            Any person who resides or is domiciled in the US can file bankruptcy. In fact, a foreigner who owns property or has a business in the US can also file bankruptcy. Partnerships, corporations and limited liability companies are also eligible to file bankruptcy. Generally, spouses file a joint bankruptcy petition but one spouse can file a bankruptcy petition alone should he deem it fit.

            Chapter 7 or the liquidation bankruptcy is the most common bankruptcy filing. Most debtors can discharge all or most of their debts under a Chapter 7 liquidation bankruptcy.  Certain debts, however, are not discharged by bankruptcy. These includes, among others, debts from fraud or those arising from the debtor’s willful and malicious acts, spousal and child support, certain student loans and certain taxes and penalties,

            A “means test” is used to determine if a debtor is eligible to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy. If the debtor’s monthly income is less than California’s family median income for his family size, he can file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. If his monthly income is more, he has to pass the means test. Otherwise, he will have to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition.

            Under a Chapter 7 liquidation bankruptcy, the debtor’s properties may be sold by the trustee to pay off their debts unless they are exempt properties. [Exempt properties are those owned by the debtor that are exempt from execution of the judgment creditors.] However, most Chapter 7 filings are considered “no asset” cases, which means that the debtor does not have non-exempt properties that trustee can sell.

          <p>
            In California, debtors can choose either one of two (2) systems of exemptions, whichever is most advantageous for them.  Note that these exemptions are applicable only to individual filers, and not to partnerships, corporations and limited liability companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            A debtor is also required to undergo credit counseling from an accredited credit counseling agency in order to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. After the petition is filed, the debtor is required to attend the meeting of creditors (called the “341 meeting”) wherein a bankruptcy trustee conducts the meeting.
