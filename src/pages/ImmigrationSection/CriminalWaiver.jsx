                    How to Obtain Waiver for Certain Criminal Grounds for Inadmissibility
                </h1>

                        An application for an immigrant visa and certain non-immigrant visas may be denied due to certain criminal grounds of inadmissibility. In some cases, the applicant can request a waiver so a visa can be issued despite that ground. A waiver is a request by the alien applicant to the U.S. government, through the USCIS, for “forgiveness” for the ground that the alien applicant has been found inadmissible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA), waivers are available for the following criminal grounds:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>
                            Certain crimes involving moral turpitude (CIMT). As a general rule, an alien who has committed or admits to committing a CIMT is inadmissible. According to the Board of Immigration Appeals, a CIMT “refers generally to conduct that shocks the public conscience as being inherently base, vile, or depraved, contrary to the rules of morality and the duties owed between man and man, either one's fellow man or society in general.” Examples of CIMT include murder, rape, incest, spousal abuse, and fraud, among others.
                        </li>
                        <li>A controlled substance violation related to a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana.</li>
                        <li>Two or more convictions (not purely political ones), for which the sentences to confinement totaled 5 years or more.</li>
                        <li>Prostitution.</li>
                        <li>Unlawful commercialized vice, whether or not related to prostitution.</li>
                        <li>Certain aliens involved in serious criminal activity who have asserted immunity from prosecution.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        However, no waiver is needed if:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>The crime was purely a political offense.</li>
                        <li>The crime was committed when the alien was under 18 years of age, and at least 5 years have passed since the alien was released from confinement and the visa application was filed.</li>
                        <li>The maximum penalty for the CIMT did not exceed imprisonment for one year, and if convicted, the sentence did not exceed six months.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        The applicant must show one of the following to qualify for a waiver:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>The applicant is an approved VAWA self-petitioner.</li>
                        <li>The U.S. citizen or permanent resident relative (spouse, son, daughter, or parent) would suffer extreme hardship if the applicant is denied.</li>
                        <li>At least 15 years have passed since the event or crime happened, and the applicant has been rehabilitated.</li>
                        <li>For crimes involving prostitution, the applicant has been rehabilitated and their admission to the U.S. is not contrary to national welfare, safety, and security.</li>
                    </ul>
