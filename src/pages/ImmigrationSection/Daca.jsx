                        Per USCIS Update dated July 17, 2019: "USCIS is not accepting requests from individuals who have never before been granted deferred action under DACA. Due to federal court orders on Jan. 9, 2018 and Feb. 13, 2018, USCIS has resumed accepting requests to renew a grant of deferred action under DACA. The scope of the Feb. 13 preliminary injunction issued in the Eastern District of New York is the same as the Jan. 9 preliminary injunction issued in the Northern District of California. Unless otherwise provided in this guidance, the DACA policy will be operated on the terms in place before it was rescinded on Sept. 5, 2017, until further notice."

                        "Individuals who were previously granted deferred action under DACA may request renewal."

                        Deferred action is meant to address the immigration concerns of certain young people who were brought to the United States as children without fault of their own and find themselves undocumented or currently out of status. These young people are likely to have been raised and studied in the U.S. for practically their entire lives. It is therefore not advisable or practical to remove these undocumented productive youth and return them to a country where they have not lived or may not know the language.

                    <p>
                        As USCIS defines it, “deferred action is a discretionary determination to defer removal action of an individual as an act of prosecutorial discretion.” In order to be eligible for deferred action, undocumented youth or individuals must:

                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>Have arrived in the U.S. when they were under the age of sixteen (16).</li>
                        <li>Have continuously resided in the U.S. for at least five years prior to June 15, 2012 and have been present in the U.S. on June 15, 2012.</li>
                        <li>Currently be in school, have graduated from high school, have a GED, or be an honorably discharged veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard or the U.S. Armed Forces.</li>
                        <li>Not have been convicted of a felony offense, a "significant misdemeanor offense," three or more non-significant misdemeanors, or otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety.</li>
                        <li>Have been under thirty-one (31) years old on June 15, 2012.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Applications will be determined on a case-by-case basis, based on USCIS guidelines. If the applicant can demonstrate that they meet the requirements listed above, they will be granted deferred action for two (2) years, which is renewable. While it does not grant lawful status like citizenship or permanent residency, they can apply for employment authorization during the deferred period, provided economic necessity for employment is shown.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Immediate relatives and dependents of people whose cases were deferred cannot be considered under the same application unless they are independently qualified themselves. Additionally, if the application for deferred action is granted, the individual can travel outside of the U.S. but must apply for advance parole before traveling.
