                        If you are a U.S citizen or a permanent resident, you can help certain relatives become permanent residents ("green card" holders) of the United States. Stated otherwise, a U.S. citizen or permanent resident can petition certain relatives for immigrant visas.

                    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Who are the family members of a US citizen or permanent resident eligible for a green card?</h2>
                    <p>If you are a U.S citizen, you can petition:</p>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>Your spouse;</li>
                        <li>Your unmarried children under 21 years of age;</li>
                        <li>Your unmarried sons or daughters 21 years of age or older;</li>
                        <li>Your married sons or daughters of any age;</li>
                        <li>Your brothers or sisters (you must be 21 years of age or older); and</li>
                        <li>Your mother or father (you must be 21 years of age or older).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you are a U.S. permanent resident, you can petition:</p>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>Your spouse;</li>
                        <li>Your unmarried child under 21 years of age; and</li>
                        <li>Your unmarried son or daughter 21 years of age or older.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Unlike a U.S. citizen, a permanent resident cannot petition his/her married sons or daughters of any age, his/her brothers or sisters, nor his/her parents.

                    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Once a petition has been approved, can one immediately migrate to the US?</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Immediate Relatives (IR)</strong><br />
                        Once a petition for an immediate relative of a U.S. citizen is approved, immigrant visas are immediately available for them so they can process their immigrant visa applicant soonest through consular processing. A spouse, unmarried children under 21 years of age, or parents of a U.S. citizen are considered immediate relatives of a U.S citizen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Family Preference Immigrant Visas</strong><br />
                        Approved immigrant petitions for a U.S. citizen’s sibling or married or adult son or daughter, or for a lawful permanent resident’s spouse, child, or unmarried son or daughter are classified to the appropriate visa preference category. Since there is fiscal year numerical limitations on these visa preference categories, these relatives will have to wait until a visa becomes available for them.
                    </p>
                    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">What are these Family Preference Categories?</h2>
                    <p>The family preference categories are as follows:</p>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>Family First Preference (F1): Unmarried Sons and Daughters of U.S. Citizens</li>
                        <li>Family Second Preference (F2): Spouses and Children, and Unmarried Sons and Daughters of Permanent Residents, further classified into:
                            <ul className="list-none ml-4">
                                <li>◦ (F2A) Spouses and Children of Permanent Residents</li>
                                <li>◦ (F2B) Unmarried Sons and Daughters (21 years of age or older) of Permanent Residents</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Family Third Preference (F3): Married Sons and Daughters of U.S. Citizens</li>
                        <li>Family Fourth Preference (F4): Brothers and Sisters of Adult U.S. Citizens</li>
                    </ul>
