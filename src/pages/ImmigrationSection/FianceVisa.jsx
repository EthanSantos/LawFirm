                    <p>
                        A U.S. citizen can bring his/her foreign fiancé(e) to the United States so they can get married by filing for his/her fiancé(e) a K-1 nonimmigrant visa, commonly referred to as the fiancé(e) visa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The U.S. citizen and his/her fiancé(e) must have the intention to marry each other within ninety (90) days of the fiancé(e) entering the U.S. as a K-1 nonimmigrant. They must have met in person within the last two (2) years prior to filing the petition, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, they must intend to marry with the goal of establishing life together as a married couple and not for the sole purpose of obtaining a green card.
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>The U.S. citizen files Form I-129F, Petition for Alien Fiancé(e), with the USCIS.</li>
                        <li>After the approval of the petition by the USCIS, it is forwarded to the National Visa Center (NVC). In turn, the NVC sends it to the U.S. Embassy or Consulate where the fiancé(e) lives.</li>
                        <li>The NVC informs the fiancé(e) beneficiary to apply for a K-1 visa and prepare for the interview.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Since the fiancé(e) will be granted a single-entry non-immigrant visa only, he/she must apply for a permanent residence immigrant visa (green card) with the USCIS in the United States after marrying the U.S. citizen within 90 days of being admitted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A U.S. citizen who is already married, or plans to marry outside the United States, cannot apply for a K-1 nonimmigrant visa for the alien beneficiary. Instead, the U.S. citizen spouse must petition the alien spouse for an immigrant visa.
