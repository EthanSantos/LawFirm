                    How to Obtain Waiver for Immigration Fraud and Misrepresentation

                        If you are an applicant for an immigration visa, K visa, or V non-immigrant visa, your application may be denied if you are found inadmissible under certain circumstances. In this case, you may file an application for a waiver for specific grounds, such as health-related grounds of inadmissibility, certain criminal grounds of inadmissibility, or immigration fraud and misrepresentation.

                        A waiver is a request by the alien applicant to the U.S. government, through the USCIS, for “forgiveness” for the ground that the alien applicant has been found inadmissible so they can be granted the visa or green card despite that ground. For instance, X, an alien married to Y, a U.S. citizen, was found inadmissible during his adjustment of status interview (or visa interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad) because he previously used a passport under a different name to enter the U.S. In this case, the only way he can be issued a green card is by getting an approved waiver application for fraud or misrepresentation.

                    <p>
                        Under Section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, “(a)ny alien who, by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact, seeks to procure (or has sought to procure or has procured) a visa, other documentation, or admission into the United States or other benefit provided under this Act is inadmissible.”

                    <p>
                        Please note that there must be a finding that:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>The alien applicant must have committed fraud or misrepresentation.</li>
                        <li>The misrepresentation must have been done willfully.</li>
                        <li>The fact was material.</li>
                        <li>The act was done to procure a visa, other documentation, or admission to the U.S., or any other benefit.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        The requirements under this provision seem straightforward, but this specific ground of inadmissibility can be very complicated at times.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To be eligible to file for this type of waiver, the following are required:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>The qualifying U.S. citizen or permanent resident relative (spouse or parent only) or the K-1 visa petitioner would experience extreme hardship if the alien applicant is denied admission, or</li>
                        <li>The alien applicant is a VAWA self-petitioner and their U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident, or qualified parent or child would experience hardship if the alien applicant is denied admission.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Remember, as stated above, there are different grounds of inadmissibility, and the waiver that is granted will only apply to the ground(s) of inadmissibility stated in the application. It is therefore important to apply for all the grounds of inadmissibility that pertain to you. Just make sure you are eligible for the other grounds of inadmissibility as well.
