                    Humanitarian Reinstatement: When the Petitioner Dies

                        An approved immediate relative and family-sponsored petition is automatically revoked upon the death of the petitioner. Based on regulations, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) can exercise its discretion and reinstate the approval of the petition for humanitarian reasons. If the petitioner dies before the immediate relative and family-sponsored petition is approved, the principal beneficiary cannot request humanitarian reinstatement. In this case, the beneficiary should consider whether they qualify to request relief under Section 204(l), Relief for Surviving Relatives.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Only the principal beneficiary can request humanitarian reinstatement, although derivative beneficiaries can accompany or follow the principal beneficiary if the approval of the petition is reinstated. There is no fee required to file for humanitarian reinstatement, and it can be filed at any time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The USCIS will review humanitarian reinstatement requests on a case-by-case basis, considering the humanitarian factors of each case. There is no specific form or format required. The principal beneficiary can send a letter, along with supporting documents, such as evidence of the beneficiary’s family members or relatives residing in the U.S., their legal relationship to the beneficiary, proof of their legal status in the U.S., and any relevant medical conditions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Factors that can be considered in support of a request for humanitarian reinstatement include:
                    </p>

                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>The impact of revocation on the family unit in the United States, especially on U.S. citizen or LPR relatives or other relatives living lawfully in the U.S.</li>
                        <li>The beneficiary’s advanced age or poor health</li>
                        <li>The beneficiary’s having resided in the U.S. lawfully for a lengthy period</li>
                        <li>The beneficiary's ties to their home country</li>
                        <li>Significant delays in processing the case after approval of the petition and after a visa number became available, if the delay is reasonably attributable to the Government rather than the beneficiary</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        These factors are not exclusive nor are they specific requirements. The request is considered in its totality and on a case-by-case basis.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The beneficiary must also have a qualifying relative willing to act as the substitute sponsor in place of the deceased petitioner. The substitute sponsor must be:
                    </p>

                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>A U.S. citizen, national, or lawful permanent resident</li>
                        <li>At least 18 years old</li>
                        <li>The beneficiary’s spouse, parent, mother-in-law, father-in-law, sibling, child, son, daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, or legal guardian</li>
                    </ul>
