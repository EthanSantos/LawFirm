                        A J-1 visa allows individuals to participate in exchange visitors programs in the US for a specific duration. The categories for J-1 visas include au pairs, camp counselors, professors and research scholars, doctors, teachers, and trainees. Certain J-1 visa holders are usually required to return to their respective home countries after completing their exchange visitor program under the two-year home-country physical presence requirement rule, as stated in Section 212(e) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA). Absent compliance with this requirement, these exchange visitors cannot change or adjust status in the US, nor receive an immigrant visa or an H, L, or K visa in a US Embassy or Consulate.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If the exchange visitor cannot comply with this two (2) year home-country physical presence requirement, they must apply for a waiver. There are five (5) bases for a waiver:
                    </p>

                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>No Objection Statement</li>
                        <li>Request by an interested U.S. federal government agency</li>
                        <li>Persecution</li>
                        <li>Exceptional hardship to a U.S. citizen (or lawful permanent resident), spouse or child of an exchange visitor</li>
                        <li>Request by a designated state public health department or its equivalent (Conrad State 30 Program)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        In the No Objection Statement basis, the government of the exchange visitorâ€™s home country must issue a No Objection Statement to the effect that it has no objection to: (a) the exchange visitor not returning to his home country to comply with the two-year home-country physical presence requirement and (b) the possibility of the exchange visitor becoming a permanent resident in the US. The No Objection Statement will be forwarded to the US State Department, Waiver Review Division, for approval.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A U.S. federal government agency may request a waiver on behalf of the exchange visitor if they are working on a project for or of interest to a U.S. federal government agency. The federal government agency must show that the departure of the exchange visitor would be detrimental to its interests. The request will be forwarded to the Waiver Review Division.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On the other hand, the waiver must be filed directly with the USCIS if the basis is either persecution or exceptional hardship. The USCIS will determine if the exchange visitor will face persecution based on race, religion, or political opinion if they return to their home country, or if the U.S. citizen (or permanent resident) spouse or child will experience extreme hardship if the exchange visitor returns to their home country. The Waiver Review Division will only proceed with the waiver recommendation if the USCIS makes a finding of either persecution or extreme hardship.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Lastly, the Conrad State 30 Program basis is solely for foreign medical doctors who received their exchange visitor J-1 status to pursue graduate medical education or training. The waiver is conditioned upon an existing offer of full-time employment at a healthcare facility in a designated healthcare professional shortage area, or at a healthcare facility that serves patients from such an area. The exchange visitor must agree to work for at least 40 hours per week for three years and should begin work at the facility within 90 days of receiving the waiver.
