        <div className="text-gray-700 space-y-4">
          <p>
            The O-1B visa is a nonimmigrant visa available to individuals who possess extraordinary ability either in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics (O-1A), or who have a demonstrated record of extraordinary achievement in the motion picture or television industry and have been recognized nationally or internationally for those achievements (O-1B).
          </p>
          <p>
            Individuals who will accompany an O-1 artist or athlete to assist in a specific event or performance can apply for O-2 visas, while spouses or children of O-1 and O-2 holders can apply for O-3 visas. For an O-1A application, evidence showing extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics must be submitted with the application, such as evidence that the beneficiary has received a major, internationally-recognized award, such as a Nobel Prize, or evidence of at least three (3) of the following:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>Receipt of nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor</li>
            <li>Membership in associations in the field which require outstanding achievements, as judged by recognized national or international experts</li>
            <li>Published material in professional or major trade publications, newspapers, or other major media about the beneficiary and their work</li>
            <li>Original scientific, scholarly, or business-related contributions of major significance in the field</li>
            <li>Authorship of scholarly articles in professional journals or other major media</li>
            <li>A high salary or other remuneration for services as evidenced by contracts or other reliable evidence</li>
            <li>Participation on a panel, or individually, as a judge of the work of others in the same field or a related field</li>
            <li>Employment in a critical or essential capacity for organizations with a distinguished reputation</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            On the other hand, O-1B applications must be accompanied by evidence that the beneficiary has received, or been nominated for, significant national or international awards or prizes in the particular field, such as an Academy Award, Emmy, Grammy, or Director's Guild Award, or evidence of at least three (3) of the following:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>Performed as a lead or starring participant in productions or events with a distinguished reputation, as evidenced by critical reviews, publicity, contracts, or endorsements</li>
            <li>Achieved national or international recognition for achievements, as shown by critical reviews or other published materials</li>
            <li>Performed in a lead, starring, or critical role for organizations with a distinguished reputation</li>
            <li>A record of major commercial or critically acclaimed successes, as shown by box office receipts, ratings, or occupational achievements</li>
            <li>Received significant recognition from organizations, critics, or government agencies</li>
            <li>A high salary or other substantial remuneration for services, as evidenced by contracts or other reliable evidence</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Comparable evidence may be submitted if the criteria above are not applicable to the alienâ€™s profession. In addition, a written consultation or advisory opinion from a peer group must be submitted, if one exists, along with the contract between the employer and the beneficiary, and the itinerary.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once the visa petition is approved, the beneficiary can apply for the visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad.
