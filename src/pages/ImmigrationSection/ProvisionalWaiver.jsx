                    Provisional Unlawful Presence Waivers of Inadmissibility for Certain Immediate Relatives

                        Certain immediate relatives of U.S. citizens are not allowed to apply for adjustment of their status to secure a green card (or permanent resident status) in the United States due to admissibility concerns. For instance, aliens who have entered the U.S. illegally or entered without inspection (“EW” or entry without inspection) cannot adjust status in the U.S., even if they are spouses or children of U.S. citizens. Previously, they had to apply for a waiver after appearing for an immigrant visa interview abroad and after a determination by the Department of State, through its embassies and consulates, that they were inadmissible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The rule on Provisional Unlawful Presence Waivers of Inadmissibility for Certain Immediate Relatives allows certain immediate relatives (spouses, children under 21 years old, and parents of U.S. citizens) to apply for provisional unlawful presence waivers of inadmissibility in the United States before departing to their countries of origin for consular processing of their immigrant visa applications.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Allowing the application for provisional unlawful presence waivers to be filed in the United States, rather than in the country of origin of the alien, significantly reduces the length of time of separation between the U.S. citizen and their immediate relatives while the latter are abroad waiting for their immigrant visa applications to be processed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        An alien immediate relative of a U.S. citizen can file for a provisional unlawful presence waiver provided the following conditions are met:
                    </p>

                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                        <li>The applicant must be an immediate relative of a U.S. citizen.</li>
                        <li>The applicant must be inadmissible only on account of unlawful presence.</li>
                        <li>The applicant can demonstrate that denial of the waiver would result in extreme hardship to their U.S. citizen spouse or parent.</li>
                    </ul>
