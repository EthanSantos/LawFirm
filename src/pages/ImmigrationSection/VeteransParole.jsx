                        <strong>Alert:</strong> The USCIS announced that it will continue the Filipino World War II Veterans Parole Program.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Filipino World War II Veterans Parole Program (“FWVP”) allows certain family members of Filipino World War II veterans (“FWV”) who are beneficiaries of an approved I-130 Petition to apply for parole with the USCIS so they can come to the U.S. while waiting for their immigrant visa to become available (or to become current). The program seeks to assist around 2,000-6,000 FWV who are currently living in the U.S. Allowing their family members to come to the U.S. on parole means these family members can provide support and care to the aging FWV.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To apply for parole, the applicants must be beneficiaries of an approved Petition for Alien Relative (I-130), including any accompanying or following-to-join spouse and children. The I-130 petition must be approved on or before filing for the parole request. The applicant's qualifying relationship with the petitioning relative must have existed on or before May 9, 2016; the petitioning relative must reside in the U.S. (or, if deceased, was residing in the U.S. at the time of death); and the petitioning relatives must have established that they are either FWV or are the surviving spouses of such individuals. If both the petitioning relative and their spouse are deceased, the eligible beneficiary can apply for parole on their own behalf, provided the I-130 petition has been reinstated by the USCIS for humanitarian reasons.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800">Can I obtain a green card through the FWVP?</h2>
                    <p>
                        No. The parole program merely allows the beneficiaries to remain in the U.S. during the period granted. To obtain a green card, you must apply and meet the eligibility requirements of a lawful permanent resident (LPR). The beneficiary can apply for adjustment of status once their priority date becomes current.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800">How long can I stay in the U.S. under the FWVP?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The initial period of time allowed under the parole program is three (3) years. However, the beneficiary can apply for re-parole at least ninety (90) days before the initial period expires. Since it may take years before the visas of the beneficiaries become current, they are responsible for ensuring they apply for re-parole when and as needed.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800">Can I work in the U.S. while under the FWVP?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Yes. Once the parole application is approved, the beneficiary can apply for an employment authorization document (EAD).
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800">Will I be interviewed by an immigration officer?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Yes. If the beneficiary is outside of the U.S., they will be interviewed by a Department of State consular officer in a U.S. Embassy or consulate abroad. If they are in the U.S., they will be interviewed by a USCIS officer. A medical examination and a background check are also required for all applicants.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800">I am a derivative beneficiary. When should I apply under the FWVP?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The petitioner who files the parole applications must file for all family members associated with the same underlying approved I-130 Petition at the same time.
                    </p>
